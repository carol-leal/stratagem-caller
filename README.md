# stratagem-caller
Stratagem Caller is a lightweight Electron-based desktop application designed for fast and intuitive input of arrow-based commands, similar to the Stratagem system in Helldivers 2. This app allows users to input directional sequences using arrow keys, instantly converting them into universal emoji symbols (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️), which can then be copied to the clipboard and used anywhere.
