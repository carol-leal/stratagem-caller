# stratagem-caller
**Stratagem Caller** is an Electron-based desktop application designed for fast and intuitive input of arrow-based commands, similar to the Stratagem system in Helldivers 2. This app allows users to input directional sequences using arrow keys, instantly converting them into universal emoji symbols (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️), which can then be copied to the clipboard and used anywhere.

## How It Works

1. **Press Arrow Keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`)** – Adds corresponding Stratagem icons to the input.
2. **Press Backspace** – Removes the last input.
3. **Press Enter** – Copies the full sequence to the clipboard and resets the display.
4. **Paste (`Ctrl + V`)** – Use the copied sequence in any chat, document, or game.
